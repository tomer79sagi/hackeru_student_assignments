             <p>Poker is a family of comparing card games in which players wager over 
                <br>
               which hand is best according to that specific game's rules. While the
               <br>
               earliest known form of the game was played with just 20 cards, today it
               <br>
               is usually played with a standard deck, although in countries where short
               <br>
               packs are common, it may be played with 32, 40 or 48 cards.[1] Thus poker
               <br>
               games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number 
               <br>
               dealt face up or face down, and the number shared by all players, but all
               <br>
               have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting.
