        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomez_Addams">Gomez Addams</a><br>

        Husband to Morticia (if indeed they are married at all) ... a crafty schemer, but also a jolly man in his own way ... though sometimes misguided ... sentimental and often puckish — optimistic, he is in full enthusiasm for his dreadful plots ... is sometimes seen in a rather formal dressing gown ... the only one who smokes.
    </p>

    <h3>Morticia</h3>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morticia_Addams">Morticia Addams</a><br>

        The real head of the family ... low-voiced, incisive and subtle, smiles are rare...ruined beauty ... contemptuous and original and with fierce family loyalty ... even in disposition, muted, witty, sometimes deadly ... given to low-keyed rhapsodies about her garden of deadly nightshade, henbane and dwarfs hair ...

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugsley_Addams">Pugsley Addams</a><br>

        An energetic monster of a boy…blond red hair, popped blue eyes and a dedicated troublemaker, in other words, the kid next door…genius in his own way, he makes toy guillotines, full size racks, threatens to poison his sister, can turn himself into a Mr. Hyde with an ordinary chemical set…his voice is hoarse…is sometimes allowed an occasional cigar.

        Wednesday Addams is a 13-year-old who is obsessed with death. Wednesday does most of her experiments on her brother Pugsley Addams for "fun" or for punishment. Wednesday has tried to kill Pugsley many times. She likes raising spiders and researching the Bermuda Triangle. She has a tendency to startle people due to her gothic personality.
