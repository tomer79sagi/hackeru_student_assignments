             Poker is a game which people play with a normal set (or deck) <span class="p2"> of 52 cards.</span></br>
             Poker is a gambling game which involves some luck, but also some skill. In poker, players make bets against each other depending on the value of their poker hand.</br>
             Bets are usually made with plastic or ceramic discs called chips.</br>
             Bets may also be made with coins or cash, but chips are more often used because they are easier to handle and count.</br>
             At the end of the game, players may swap their chips for money.</br>
             If the players are not playing for real money, the chips are counted at the end of the game to determine the order of winners.
             There are many different kinds of poker.</br>
             In draw poker, each player is dealt five cards.</br>
             <span class="p3"> player can decide to throw away a number of these cards and then take (draw) new cards to replace them.</br>
             In stud poker (for example, seven-card stud), some of each player's cards are laid (face-up) on the table so that the other players can see them.</br>
             In community card poker (for example, Texas hold 'em), players share some of their cards in the center of the table.
