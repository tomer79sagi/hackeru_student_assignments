        In casual play, the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a <br>
        dealer button (or buck). In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, but the button (typically <br>
        a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order <br>
        of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table, one at a time. <br> <br>

        One or more players are usually required to make forced bets, usually either an ante or a blind bet (sometimes <br>
        both). The dealer shuffles the cards, the player on the chair to his or her right cuts, and the dealer deals the <br>
        appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to his or her left. Cards <br>
        may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial <br>
        deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some <br>
        way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all <br>
        bets are gathered into the central pot. <br><br>

        At any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to call (match) the bet, and all <br>
        opponents instead fold, the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be <br>
        shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes bluffing possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, <br>
        distinguishing it from other vying games and from other games that use poker hand rankings. <br><br>

        At the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown, in which the players <br>
        reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the <br>
        poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more <br>
        than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts. There are 10 different kinds of <br>
        poker hands, such as straight flush and four of a kind. <br><br>
