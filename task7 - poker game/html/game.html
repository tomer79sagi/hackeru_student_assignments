      Poker is a family of comparing card games in which players wager over
      which hand is best according to that specific game's rules. While the
      earliest known form of the game was played with just 20 cards, today it is
      usually played with a standard deck, although in countries where short
      packs are common, it may be played with 32, 40 or 48 cards.[1] Thus poker
      games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number
      dealt face up or face down, and the number shared by all players, but all
      have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most modern poker games, the first round of betting begins with one or
      more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the blind or ante).
      In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe
      their hand is worth as compared to the other players. The action then
      proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or "call")
      the maximum previous bet, or fold, losing the amount bet so far and all
      further involvement in the hand. A player who matches a bet may also
      "raise" (increase) the bet. The betting round ends when all players have
      either called the last bet or folded. If all but one player folds on any
      round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to
      reveal their hand. If more than one player remains in contention after the
      final betting round, a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed,
      and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the
      pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive
      expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various
      strategic reasons. Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand
      significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players
      are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability,
      psychology, and game theory. Poker has increased in popularity since the
      beginning of the 20th century and has gone from being primarily a
      recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts to a widely
      popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online,
      with many professional players and multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.
