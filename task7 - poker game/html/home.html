        Don’t Fall for Tilt. Tilt is one of the key terms you should learn when
        you play poker online, free or paid. It’s a classic situation when a
        player loses their cool, starts getting emotional, and makes crucial
        mistakes because of it. Keeping your cool and understanding that poker
        is a game of composure can be the difference maker between losing early
        and sticking it out for the win.
      </p>

        Be Aggressive at the Right Time. Even though it’s a good idea for
        beginners to be cautious, you can’t win if you always check and fold
        when playing poker games online. Even when you play poker for free, it’s
        still a good idea to be aggressive and protect your pot, so if you have
        a strong hand, don’t be afraid to be bold and place bets or raise early
        to deter some of the players.

        Keep an eye on how much you bet! One of the most important attributes of
        every winning poker player is their tendency to bet larger amounts when
        their hand is stronger, and smaller amounts when their hand is weaker.
        In fact, the best players regularly fold (give up their hand without
        betting) when the cards they have been dealt are not particularly
        strong. The best players, indeed, fold most of their poker hands!
