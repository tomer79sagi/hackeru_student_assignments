      (/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/ (listen) bə-RAHK hoo-SAYN oh-BAH-mə;[1] born
      August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th president
      of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party,
      he was the first African-American president of the United States.[2] Obama
      previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as
      an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Obama was born in Honolulu,
      Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a
      community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law
      School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review.
      After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic,
      teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from
      1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th
      district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the
      U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March
      Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention
      keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In
      2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was
      nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama was elected over
      Republican nominee John McCain in the general election and was inaugurated
      alongside his running mate Joe Biden, on January 20, 2009. Nine months
      later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that
      drew a mixture of praise and criticism.
